        <h1 class="p-white">Terms &amp; Conditions of Entry – Uber Backseat Arcade</h1>
        <ol role="list" class="list">
          <li class="list-item">Information on how to enter and the prizes form part of these Terms and Conditions. Participation in the Uber Backseat Arcade promotion ("Promotion") is deemed acceptance of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
          <li class="list-item">The promoter is Uber Australia Pty Ltd (ABN 49 160 299 865) of 1 O&#x27;Connell St, Sydney NSW 2000 ("Promoter").</li>
          <li class="list-item">Entry is only open to individuals aged 18 years or over with an Uber account in New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and Tasmania ("Participating Locations"). Employees of the Promoter and agencies associated with this promotion involved in the conduct of the Promotion are ineligible to enter.</li>
          <li class="list-item">The Promotion commences at 9am on 8 December 2025 and ends when all Promo Codes have been claimed in accordance with clause 15 or 11:59pm on 21 December 2025, whichever occurs first ("Promotional Period"). All times indicated are in Australian Eastern Daylight Time.</li>
          <li class="list-item">For a chance to play, you must request a trip using the Uber app in a Participating Location during the Promotional Period ("Trip").</li>
          <li class="list-item">If the Uber Backseat Arcade banner appears in-app during the Trip, to participate in the Promotion, you must:<br><br>(a) tap on the banner to open the Uber Backseat Arcade site; and<br><br>(b) select and play one or more of the games set out in the table below (each, a "Game") within 10 minutes from the time you commence playing your first Game ("Time Limit"):<br><br><strong class="game-name-tc">Brick Breaker</strong><br>Break through the wall of bricks to rack up points and clear each level. Keep your eye on the ball and watch out for those power-ups!<br><br><strong>Prize Score:</strong><br>Tier 1: 10,000 – 19,999<br>Tier 2: 20,000 – 49,999<br>Tier 3: 50,000 or more<br><br><strong class="game-name-tc">Meteors</strong><br>Blast your way through space, dodging flying rocks and racking up points with every hit. The asteroids keep coming, and only the fastest survive.<br><br><strong>Prize Score:</strong><br>Tier 1: 1,500 – 3,999<br>Tier 2: 4,000 – 6,999<br>Tier 3: 7,000 or more<br><br><strong class="game-name-tc">Snake</strong><br>Eat, grow &amp; survive for as long as you can. The more you eat, the longer you get. Just don&#x27;t hit the walls or your own tail!<br><br><strong>Prize Score:</strong><br>Tier 1: 10 – 19<br>Tier 2: 20 – 39<br>Tier 3: 40 or more</li>
          <li class="list-item">There is an element of chance in whether the Uber Backseat Arcade banner appears in-app during a Trip because the banner is a rotating advertising space and the Promoter cannot guarantee that it will appear during every Trip. However, the award of Promo Codes is based solely on the entrant's performance in the Game, which requires skill, speed and accuracy.</li>
          <li class="list-item">You cannot access Uber Backseat Arcade unless you click through the in-app banner during a Trip.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Each Prize Score Tier corresponds to an Uber ride promo code prize, as set out in paragraph 23 below ("Promo Code").</li>
          <li class="list-item">The Promo Code is only valid on a subsequent Uber ride. You cannot redeem the Promo Code on the Trip during which you claimed it.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If you achieve a Prize Score, you will immediately receive an on screen notification confirming the Promo Code corresponding to your Prize Score Tier and presenting you with the option to:<br><br>(a) claim the Promo Code; or<br>(b) forfeit the Promo Code and play again.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If you choose to play again, the process set out in paragraph 11 will repeat until you claim a Promo Code or the Time Limit expires, whichever occurs earlier.</li>
          <li class="list-item">You may participate in the Promotion and claim a Promo Code multiple times, provided that you may only claim 1 Promo Code per Trip.</li>
          <li class="list-item">You are only entitled to claim the Promo Code corresponding to your latest Prize Score. For example, if you achieve a Tier 2 Prize Score, choose to play again and, in the next Game:<br><br>(a) achieve a Tier 1 Prize Score, you will only be eligible to claim a Tier 1 Promo Code; or<br>(b) do not achieve a Prize Score, you will not be eligible to claim a Promo Code.</li>
          <li class="list-item">To claim a Promo Code, you must do the following before the Time Limit expires:<br><br>(a) tap the button 'Claim your prize'; and<br>(b) tap to 'Confirm' you want to claim your prize and be redirected to the Uber app.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If you complete the steps in paragraph 15, the Promo Code will be automatically added to your Uber account.</li>
          <li class="list-item">You will forfeit your Promo Code if you do not claim it in accordance with paragraph 15.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If your Trip ends, you may continue playing until expiry of the Time Limit.</li>
          <li class="list-item">The Promoter reserves the right, at any time, to verify the validity of entries and entrants (including an entrant's identity, age and place of residence) and reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify any individual who the Promoter has reason to believe has breached any of these Terms and Conditions, tampered with the entry process or engaged in any unlawful or other improper misconduct calculated to jeopardise fair and proper conduct of the promotion. Failure by the Promoter to enforce any of its rights at any stage does not constitute a waiver of those rights. The Promoter&#x27;s legal rights to recover damages or other compensation from such an offender are reserved.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If there is a dispute as to the identity of an entrant, the Promoter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the identity of the entrant.</li>
          <li class="list-item">The Promoter's decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into.</li>
          <li class="list-item">There will be up to 33,334 winners.</li>
          <li class="list-item">There are a total of 33,334 Promo Codes available (with a total prize pool value of $250,000), as follows:<br><br><strong>Prize Score Tier 1:</strong> 10% off an Uber ride (max $5 off) – Quantity: 20,001<br><strong>Prize Score Tier 2:</strong> 20% off an Uber ride (max $10 off) – Quantity: 10,000<br><strong>Prize Score Tier 3:</strong> 30% off an Uber ride (max $15 off) – Quantity: 3,333</li>

          <li class="list-item">Promo Codes are not exchangeable or transferable and cannot be taken as cash unless specified otherwise.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If a prize is unavailable, the Promoter, in its discretion, reserves the right to substitute the prize with a prize to the equal value and/or specification, subject to any directions of any regulatory authority.</li>
          <li class="list-item">Entrants consent to the Promoter and its affiliates using their name and score in the event they are a winner in any media for an unlimited period without remuneration for the purpose of promoting this promotion (including any outcome), and promoting any products manufactured, distributed and/or supplied by the Promoter.</li>
          <li class="list-item">If this Promotion is interfered with in any way or is not capable of being conducted as reasonably anticipated due to any reason beyond the reasonable control of the Promoter, including but not limited to technical difficulties, unauthorised intervention or fraud, the Promoter reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law: (a) to disqualify any entrant; or (b) subject to any written directions from a regulatory authority, to modify, suspend, terminate or cancel the promotion, as appropriate.</li>
